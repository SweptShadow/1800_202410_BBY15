# Project Title
Bus-With-Us


## 1. Project Description
Our team BBY15 is developing a web application to help people who commute by providing them with bus route and occupancy information.
This browser based web application is to provide bus occupancy and bus route information to commuters in the lower mainland.

## 2. Names of Contributors
* Hi, my name is Arsh Mann! I am excited to develop my first application!
* Daniil's honest reaction: AAAAAA, I'm so excited.
* Hi, my name is Dil! I am excited to work on my first hands-on project.
	
## 3. Technologies and Resources Used
List technologies (with version numbers), API's, icons, fonts, images, media or data sources, and other resources that were used.
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Bootstrap 5.0 (Frontend library)
* Firebase 8.0 (BAAS - Backend as a Service)
* Google Map API
* Photoshop for maps (instead of doing overlay for maps we used images)
* Google Fonts

## 4. Complete setup/installion/usage
State what a user needs to do when they come to your project.  How do others start using your code or application?
Here are the steps:
* Sign up via email or guest log in
* Find the relvent route or stop
* View the information our application provide
* Write review of bus stops to update our db and make the informaiton more accurate.

## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* Some layouts (other than mobile) do not work as intended
* JS code may break when trying to implement new features (we cut back on those feature because we couldn't get code to work in unison)

## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Use the Trans-Link API key to get real-time bus route and location information.
* Instead of different images for the color coded bus stop occupancy have it be projected live on a map.
* Implement the Karma system we wanted to implement.
* Link to other applications seemlessly so users would want to use our application more readily.
